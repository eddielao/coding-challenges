# Challenge

The objective is to reproduce the same behavior output by the Erlang module in Ruby. Ruby codes are in the file [`erlang_program.rb`](./erlang_program.rb).

## Sample Output

## Notes

Given the more flexibilities of Ruby, there are many other ways (using less time or space complexities). However, my take on this challenge is to really learn the Erlang language and to try to mimic the structures of the original codes but in Ruby.
