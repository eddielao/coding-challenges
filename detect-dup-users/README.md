# Intro

The heart of this challenge is to develop an algorithm that detects duplicated user accounts. For more detail, please refer to [`challenge.md`](./challenge.md) file.

## Setup

### Installations

Node needs to be installed before proceeding. Create a directory for the app and run the following terminal commands inside that app directory.

To create `package.json`, run `npm init`.

```
$ npm init
```

This command also asks for a number of inputs which the defaults can be accepted to save time. One exception is the name of the entry file, defaulted to `index.js`. It is common to name it to match your app.

Next is to install Express and to save it in the dependencies list with the option `--save`. 

```
$ npm install express --save
```
