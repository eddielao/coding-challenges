# Problem

Given a stock's prices for the next n days, find the maximum profit for a single buy-sell transaction. For example, [10, 200, 5, 196] gives maximum profit of 191 (196 - 5). Notice that the answer does not necessarily come from the max and the min in the array. Please solve this in linear time complexity, O(N), and in constant space complexity.
